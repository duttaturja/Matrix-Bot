			    	                    ------------

         A submatrix of A is a matrix formed by selecting from A a subset of the rows. and a subset of the columns. and   forming a new matrix by using those entries, in the same relative positions, that appear in both the rows and columns   of those selected.

  Example : 


                 1  2  3
  If  A =        4  5  6
                 7  8  9

  Than,

           A{1,2} =    1   2 
                       4   5

           A{2,2} =    2   3
                       5   6 

           A{2,3} =    4   5
