			    	               ------------------

         A square matrix A which of size n Ã— n is considered to be symmetric if and only if AT = A. Consider the given   matrix A, that is, a square matrix that is equal to the transposed form of that matrix, called a symmetric matrix.
  This can be represented as: If A = [A(ij)]nxn is the symmetric matrix, then B(ij) = B(ji) for all i and j or 1 <= i <=  n, and 1 <= j <= n. Here,
  ->    n is any natural number.
  ->    B(ij) is an element at position (i, j) which is ith row and jth column in matrix B and
  ->    B(ji) is an element at position (j, i) which is jth row and ith column in matrix B.
