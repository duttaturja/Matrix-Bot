 						NILPOTENT MATRIX
			    	               ------------------

         A nilpotent matrix is a square matrix A such that An = 0. Here k is called the index or exponent of the matrix,  and 0 is a null matrix with the same order as that of matrix A. The matrix multiplication operation is useful to find   if the given matrix is a nilpotent matrix or not. Further, the exponent of a nilpotent matrix is lesser than or equal   to the order of the matrix (n < N).

  Examples of Nilpotent Matrix :
  An example of 2 x 2 Nilpotent Matrix is
                                       

				       A =     4 -4
                                               4 -4

                                      
				      A^2 =    0  0
                                               0  0
