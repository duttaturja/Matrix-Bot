			    	               -------------------

         The transpose of a matrix is found by interchanging its rows into columns or columns into rows. The transpose    of the matrix is denoted by using the letter "T" in the superscript of the given matrix. For example, if "A" is the     given matrix, then the transpose of the matrix is represented by A' or A[T].
  Let us check the below example to understand more clearly about how to find the transpose of a matrix.

                -2   5   6
        A=      5    2   7
                6    7   7 
  In the above example, we can see that the given matrix of order 3 x 3. The elements of the first row [-2, 5, 6] are     written in the first column, and the elements in the second row [5, 2, 7] are written in the second column and the      third row [6 , 7 , 7] are written in the third columnto obtain the transpose matrix. The transpose of the matrix A is   A[T] and has an order of 3 x 3.

                -2   5   6
      A[T] =    5    2   7
                6    7   7
