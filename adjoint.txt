			    	                ----------------

         Let A=[A(ij)] be a square matrix of order n . The adjoint of a matrix A is the transpose of the cofactor matrix  of A . It is denoted by adj A . An adjoint matrix is also called an adjugate matrix.
  Example:

  Find the adjoint of the matrix.

             3    2   1
    A=       1   -2   2
            -1    0  -1
  To find the adjoint of a matrix, first find the cofactor matrix of the given matrix. Then find the transpose of the     cofactor matrix.

  Cofactor of 3  =  A(1,1)  =    -2    2
                                  0   -1     =  2

  Cofactor of 1  = A(1,2)   =     -2   1
                                   0  -1     = 2


  Cofactor -1 = A(1,3)      =      2   1
                                  -2   2     = 6


  and so on....

  Now find the transpose of A(ij)

                              2      -1       2
  adj A=   (Aij)T  =          2      -2      -2
                              6      -5      -8
